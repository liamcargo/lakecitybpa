                <p id="JMP">At the age of 23, I could no longer get out of bed in the mornings and put my feet on the ground without feeling I had heavy weights around my ankles. I could barely drag myself to the bathroom. I had no idea what was happening. After a month of not getting out of bed, I moved back home with my parents, where my depressive state worsened and I attempted suicide.
                For the next three years, I was hospitalized on more than one occasion; I saw doctor after doctor, therapist after therapist, took medication after medication, received a series of ECT shock therapy treatments to address the almost catatonic state that I was in. Finally, at the age of 26, I received a diagnosis of bipolar 1 disorder. I felt a sense of relief to finally know what was “wrong” with me.
                <br><br>
                For the past two decades, I have been living with bipolar 1 disorder — a mental health condition that I will battle for the rest of my life. Mental illness, particularly serious mental illness (SMI) is not a "quick fix" — it is an ongoing journey. My bipolar diagnosis will be a constant presence in my life. One thing this illness will not do, however, is define the person that I am today. I am not ashamed for people to know what I have been through. And I’m proud of who I have become.
                I am a college graduate, I am a wife, a full-time mother to three beautiful girls who are 16, 12 and 9 years old. I work full-time in the supply chain field. My life is enriching and fulfilling due to my spiritual beliefs, the medical treatment plan I follow and the education and research I consult to stay well. I have defied many of the limiting assumptions people may have about my potential and ability.
                <br><br>
                While I have found self-love and confidence, I worry about others grappling with mental health conditions. Mental illness should not be treated any differently from physical illness — but it is. Due to the stigma surrounding mental illness, people living with mental health challenges face unfair assumptions, negative attitudes and unpleasant stereotypes. I have experienced this firsthand. My hope for the future is that we can advance the conversation about mental health and squash the stigma that limits us.
                A crucial part of changing the narrative is understanding that properly addressing mental health takes time and patience. Many people living with mental illness in our communities are suffering in silence, plagued by the stigma of disclosing our challenges and asking for help. But this can change; we have the power to come together and raise awareness through sharing our lived experience.
                For many years, as I pursued recovery, people gave to me. It's my turn to do the same for others who are fighting their own battles. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. famously said, "Darkness cannot drive out darkness. Hate cannot drive out hate, only love can do that." Let's continue to be guided by love as we address mental health issues in this country.</p>

                <p id="DSP">I am not going to lie, the past few years have been the hardest of my life. I had a fairy tale marriage, things seemed “perfect,” and it felt like they were always getting better. As far as I was concerned, I was living the dream, second to none. Then my whole universe was ripped apart after my wife died by suicide, and all that was left behind was a cold, lonely, shell of a man trying to make sense of it all. And it didn’t make any sense at all.
                My wife had taken her life, and all I could think was I need to be with her to look after her, wherever she has gone. But then I realized that other people needed me here — my daughters, grandchildren, mother, brother, sister… the list is endless.
                <br><br>
                Drinking became my solution and coping mechanism, and it seemed to work for a while, but with the highs come the lows — and the lows were dark. My family and friends were very supportive, but I needed more. My youngest daughter must have seen something wasn’t right.
                “Dad,” she said, “there is a local group called It’s Worth Talking About, a group which deals with mental health issues.” <br><br>

                I don’t need any mental health group, I thought… I was just the man who, on many occasions, drove his car passed the crematorium, played sad music, rolled his window down, looked up to the sky and sobbed his heart out. I was just the man who was drinking night after night with different people to take away the loneliness. I was just the man who could not get out of bed. I was just the man that put on a really bad brave face just to survive. I was a 60-year-old man, my life was over, what I needed was alcohol, more isolation and a lot more crying. But I had a choice.
                One Tuesday night, I was at a friend’s house, only 10 minutes from this peer group venue. My friend was pouring me my second whisky when I said, “No, I am going to try this group thing.”
                <br><br>
                I recall my first meeting clearly, a few guys sitting around a table talking about the week they’d had — some had a good week, some hadn't, and I knew I hadn't— but within about 20 minutes I knew I was among friends, caring friends. Initially, I had gone with the intention of just listening, 
                but within another 20 minutes I was pouring my heart out, crying my eyes out. And it felt great. I felt at ease. I felt heard by people with a real understanding of what I was going through — people who had or were going through similar circumstances. I left the meeting and called my daughter, 
                talking non-stop about what I had experienced.
                <br><br>
                For the first time, I felt hopeful. It was only a slight bit of hope, but I could see light, a faint light, and realized that maybe I could get through this with help.
                I now attend this group every week and have been going now for over a year. I continue to go so I can give something back. I go to give support to the facilitator by giving advice, comfort and understanding to all the old and the new guys who take that brave step to walk through our doors.
                My life was once over; I had lost the most precious person in my life. But I hope that her story — and mine — can inspire people to talk. To seek help from friends, family and your local support groups. I will never “get over” losing my wife, but I am learning to live with it. I will never forget her, and I know that peer support is there for me and always will be.

                <p id="PPP">On Jan. 31, 2022, I found myself in the admissions building of an inpatient psychiatric care facility where I would spend the next 28 days in an intensive Dialectic Behavioral Therapy program. I admitted myself of my own volition — afraid, anxious, hopeless and unsure of what to expect. However, having the courage to make this decision was long overdue.
                My struggles with my mental health began as a child. After being physically, psychologically and emotionally abused by my maternal grandmother for the first seven years of my life, I not only developed what would later be diagnosed as PTSD, but developmental disorders, self-esteem issues, intimacy issues and both physical and emotional scars that would haunt me for the next three decades. I never spoke up.
                <br><br>
                When I was 16, I was a model student on the outside. I was in the top ten people in my graduating class, volunteered at a hospital, presided over several clubs and activities, played baseball, made friends and had a girlfriend. On the inside, I was suffering from debilitating panic attacks and suicidal thoughts. I spent days in bed. I never spoke up.
                When I was in my early 20s, I began to lose total control of my inner dialogue and mental health. I was given a prescription for a Ativan tablets, which I ran through in a week, and I was referred to a therapist. 
                <br><br>
                In therapy, I couldn’t find the words to describe how terrible I was feeling. I continued to suffer alone. I never spoke up.
                At twenty-one, I finally saw a psychiatrist and was formally diagnosed with PTSD, insomnia and a host of other depressive and anxiety disorders. I was prescribed medications I didn’t know the names of. I also didn’t know the side effects, of which there were many. I stopped taking them. I struggled my way through college masking all my pain with substance abuse. I never spoke up.
                <br><br>
                Throughout my 20s, I experienced true hopelessness. Occupational issues, relationship issues and family issues compounded my existing challenges and led to a constant thunderstorm of depression, loneliness, isolation, substance abuse and worsening mental health. 
                I saw friends getting engaged, buying houses, getting their dream jobs and living seemingly happy lives. I withdrew. I spent years alone; hiding myself from the outside world because I didn’t feel like I belonged in it. I resigned myself to a sad, hopeless, unfulfilling life. 
                <br><br>
                I buried myself in my work to distract my brain from the intrusive and traumatic thoughts that continued to feed all the pain I went through. Friends saw me struggle. Family saw me struggle. I never spoke up.
                In December 2021, I found myself lying in bed for days at a time, not sleeping, not eating and ignoring messages from friends. I had given up and was planning to end my own life. Luckily, there was a small glimmer of hope in me that I could be better. I recognized how I gave so much love to friends, family and my community — I just needed to give some to myself. So I spoke up.
                <br><br>
                After my stay at the inpatient facility, I have a new lease on life. My friends and family are loving, caring and supportive. They were proud of me for having the guts to admit that I wasn’t alright and needed help. I don’t look at the past anymore. I’m focused on the future. Part of my future is going to be making sure that people who are struggling can get the help they need when they need it.
                The stigma surrounding mental health — both at the individual and societal level — discourages people from taking the steps I took. 
                <br><br>
                Even when people want to reach out to help, the resources are often unavailable. I’ve been through that, and it exacerbates all the mental health conditions that overwhelmed me.
                I’ve seen friends and family members lose their battle with their mental health. I never want to see that again. Speaking up is hard. It’s still hard for me. However, talking to anyone in your life is free. Even without any resources, having someone who has your back and being truthful with them will help. It will help change the discourse on mental health and the preconceptions and stigmas surrounding it.
                I spoke up. So should you.</p>
